- Preparation:
- 
- Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C).
- Clean and Season the Turkey:
- 
- Remove the turkey from its packaging. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity and save them for making gravy or discard.
- Pat the turkey dry with paper towels. Season the cavity with salt and pepper.
- Herb Butter Rub:

- Place the quartered onion, lemon, and orange into the turkey cavity.
- Tie the Legs:
- 
- If the turkey legs are not tied, use kitchen twine to tie them together. This helps the turkey cook more evenly.
- Roasting:
- 
- Place the turkey on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Pour the chicken or turkey broth into the bottom of the pan.
- Smear the remaining herb butter over the entire surface of the turkey.
- Roasting Time:
- 
- Roast the turkey in the preheated oven, basting every 30 minutes with the pan juices. Roast until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) in the thickest part of the thigh, and the juices run clear. This typically takes about 3 to 4 hours, dependin
- Resting:

- structions:
- Preparation:
- 
- Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C).
- Score the Ham:
- 
- Place the ham on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to score the top of the ham in a diamond pattern. Make shallow cuts about 1/4-inch deep.
- Mix Glaze Ingredients:
- 
- In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine honey, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, and ground nutmeg. Stir well and simmer for 5-7 minutes until the glaze thickens slightly.
- Glaze the Ham:
- 
- Place the scored ham in a roasting pan. Brush a generous amount of the honey glaze over the entire surface of the ham, ensuring it gets into the scored cuts.
- Bake:
- 
- Cover the ham with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven. Bake for about 15-20 minutes per pound or until the internal temperature reaches 140°F (60°C).
- Baste:
- 
- Every 30 minutes, baste the ham with the pan juices and additional honey glaze.
- Optional Cloves:
- 
- If desired, you can stud the ham with whole cloves at the intersections of the diamond pattern for a decorative touch.
- Final Glazing:
- 
- During the last 15-20 minutes of baking, remove the foil and brush the ham with more honey glaze. This will give it a shiny finish.
- Resting:
- 
- Once the ham reaches the desired temperature, remove it from the oven, tent it loosely with foil, and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes before slicing.
- Serving:
- 
- Carve the ham into slices and serve with any remaining glaze on the side.
